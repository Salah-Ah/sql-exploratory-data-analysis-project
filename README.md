## 💫 About Me

Hi there! I'm **Salah Ahmed Mohamed Mohamed**, a **Data Analyst | Aspiring Data Engineer** passionate about transforming raw data into meaningful insights. 

I specialize in building end-to-end data solutions using **SQL**, **Power BI**, **Excel**, and **statistical analysis**. My technical expertise spans advanced topics like DAX, M Code, data modeling, ETL pipelines, stored procedures, and data warehouse design. I'm particularly drawn to projects in **marketing**, **real estate**, and **supply chain** domains, where data-driven decisions create tangible business impact.

I believe in precision, continuous learning, and delivering work that bridges the gap between technical complexity and business value. Currently, I'm expanding my portfolio with diverse projects in data analytics and engineering—because the best way to learn is by building.
